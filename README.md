## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats


### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- vnailla JS


### Continued development

During working on this challenge I ran into several things, I did`n know how to do:
- what element should the card be? It has a hover effect, which means it is interactive, but what it is supposed to do is not obvious. So i have made it with plane div, that has a hover effect
- what element should the menu-item be (those weekly, monthly and so forth)? A radio-button? A button? So I made them links. With no logic under it.

Thus my continued development is learning more about semantics and UI elements and what they supposed to do. Also I learn deeper css and js (including React one day).
